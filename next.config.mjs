/**
 * WHY `'unsafe-inline'` IS STILL IN script-src, DELIBERATELY.
 *
 * The standard fix is a per-request nonce: generate one in middleware, stamp it
 * on every inline <script>, and drop 'unsafe-inline'. That does not work on
 * this site, and forcing it would cause a much larger problem than it solves.
 *
 * A nonce is per-REQUEST by definition. To stamp it on the 19 JSON-LD blocks
 * across the app, each of those Server Components must read `headers()`. In the
 * App Router, calling `headers()` opts the route into DYNAMIC rendering. Those
 * blocks live on the clinic, guide, news, provider and city pages, which are
 * exactly the pages served by ISR (`export const revalidate = 300`) and
 * pre-rendered via `generateStaticParams`.
 *
 * So adopting nonces would convert essentially every public page from cached
 * ISR to per-request server rendering. Every visit would hit Postgres through
 * a pool capped at 4. That is the precise failure mode the rest of this work
 * exists to prevent, traded for a CSP improvement.
 *
 * Hash-based CSP is not an alternative either: Next.js emits its own inline
 * hydration bootstrap whose contents change per page and per build, so the
 * hash set cannot be known ahead of time.
 *
 * The residual risk is mitigated in depth: React escapes by default, all
 * JSON-LD is serialized with `JSON.stringify(...).replace(/</g, '\\u003c')`,
 * rich text is sanitized, `object-src`, `base-uri`, `form-action` and
 * `frame-ancestors` are all locked down, and inputs are Zod-validated.
 *
 * To revisit with real data, set CSP_REPORT_ONLY=true. That ships an additional
 * Content-Security-Policy-Report-Only header carrying the strict policy while
 * the permissive one stays enforced, so violations are reported to
 * /api/csp-report without anything breaking.
